// A certificate must not be installable into a document it is not about.

// `verifyCertificate` is handed raw bytes and a hostname, so it cannot know
// which document those bytes were about to be filed in. A certificate that is
// perfectly valid for document A says nothing about document B, and without
// this check the app would happily store it there — where a later reader,
// applying the same check on the way out, would find a valid-looking
// certificate in a document that never accepted the name.
//
// This regressed once already, in the read path, and was found by planting a
// certificate by hand. Encoding it here means the next regression is loud.
