// Seeding the onomancy test binding into a local browser.
//
// The document `onotest.brooklynzelenka.com` designates cannot replicate: its
// id is a self-certifying ed25519 key, which ARK classifies as keyhive-
// protected by shape, but it was minted by `onomancer` rather than by keyhive.
// So no keyhive state exists for it, no relay grant is possible, and no
// replica ever arrives from the sync server. ADR-023 has the full closure.
//
// Testing the certificate path therefore means seeding it locally rather than
// receiving it. Exposed on `window` beside the other debug handles rather than
// wired into the UI: it is a fixture for exercising a path, not a feature, and
// putting it behind a button would imply the demo can adopt arbitrary bound
// documents. It cannot — that is the whole finding.
