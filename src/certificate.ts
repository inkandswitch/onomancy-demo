/**
 * A designation that requires the **reverse binding**, not just the forward one.
 *
 * The DNS record proves `hostname -> document`. On its own that is a claim the
 * domain makes unilaterally: any zone may name any document id, and the
 * document's admins cannot decline. The onomancy certificate held *in* that
 * document is the other direction — the document, through an admin key,
 * asserting the hostname. The spec is explicit that a verified binding needs
 * both (`dns-anchor.md`, "A verified DNS binding proves exactly this"), and a
 * conforming verifier refuses with `no-certificate-held` when the reverse half
 * is absent.
 *
 * `createKeyhiveDesignation` alone checks only that the identity administers
 * the designated document. That is necessary and not sufficient: it shows the
 * identity *could have* signed a certificate, never that one exists. Reporting
 * `verified` on it is not a weaker claim than the spec's — it is a different
 * one, and the glyph does not distinguish them.
 *
 * So this composes the two and takes the weaker verdict:
 *
 * | keyhive says | certificate | result |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | designates | accepted, mutual | **designates** |
 * | designates | absent | `unknown` — not proven, not disproven |
 * | designates | rejected | `excludes` — evidence arrived and failed |
 * | anything else | — | unchanged |
 *
 * Absence maps to `unknown` rather than `excludes` deliberately. A document
 * that carries no certificate has not *denied* the domain; it has said
 * nothing, and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. A certificate
 * that arrived and failed verification is different in kind, and that one does
 * convict.
 *
 * One consequence: `createKeyhiveDesignation` short-circuits when a bound id
 * *is* the identity, and wrapping it makes that case `unknown` — a bare key
 * holds no certificate. That is correct; `p=` names a document. See ADR-031.
